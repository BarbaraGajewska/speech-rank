			<p>The amount of information in internet is overwhelming. The only problem is to easily find valuable resources. Due to highly dynamic nature of our profession - software development - we need to learn and to improve almost every single day. One of the best ways to learn is attend conferences and directly learn from the greatest in our industry. However, it is physically impossible not only to go to every conference but even to see all important stuff on a single conference.</p> 

			<p>That’s why we created our application. It helps to find recorded presentations from top software conferences and all of them in one place, no matter if they are on Youtube, Vimeo, Parleys or anything else.. And that is just the first step; remember - the amount of information is overwhelming. So the app provides some means to find the most valuable content. Currently only global ranks and comments are provided but in the future we hope to include something like recommendations from people that you trust and admire. How nice it would be to find what inspirations for e.g. Martin Fowler are. How valuable it would be to make a poll with your friends after a conference which presentations they found the best (popularity among all people globally doesn’t necessarily mean best for you). Next step could be to provide auto-suggestions basing on your Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn links/likes.</p>

			<p>It would be awesome to watch best videos from IT conferences around the world (and know what your friends recommend). All of them, in one place, no matter if they are on Youtube, Vimeo, Parleys or anything else. The Speech Rank  is a web application that allows to easily navigate through conferences from last years and watch, rate, and comment their presentations.<br />
			This is how we interpreted Community theme. The access to information is not a problem any more. What matters now is the properly tailored information that saves you time and energy. As a software developers we would love to have tools which aggregate information from industry, so it's easier to find best knowledge resources .
			The next step would be to add recommendations from people you follow, so the speech rank is not average from the whole world, only your closest community.</p>
